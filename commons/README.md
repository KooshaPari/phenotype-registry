# phenotype-python-sdk

Monorepo of Phenotype org Python (and polyglot) SDK kits, consolidated from standalone kit repositories.

## Workspace kits

| Kit | Path | Role |
|-----|------|------|
| **mcp-kit** | `packages/mcp-kit` | Model Context Protocol tooling (Python, Rust, Go) |
| **testing-kit** | `packages/testing-kit` | QA, quality CLI, analysis, and test harnesses |
| **auth-kit** | `packages/auth-kit` | Authentication and security helpers |
| **resilience-kit** | `packages/resilience-kit` | Deploy, CI/CD, and resilience utilities |

### Python sub-projects (under kits)

- `packages/testing-kit/python/` — `qa-kit`, `pheno-testing-cli`, `pheno-quality-tools`, `pheno-quality-cli`, `pheno-analysis-cli`, `mcp-qa`
- `packages/resilience-kit/python/` — `deploy-kit`, `ci-cd-kit`, `pheno-deploy`

See each package’s `README.md` and `pyproject.toml` for install and usage.

## Development

Root `pyproject.toml` documents the workspace layout. Per-package tooling may use Poetry, setuptools, or Hatch — follow the kit you are changing.

```bash
cd packages/<kit>/python   # when applicable
# use that package's documented install (poetry install, pip install -e ., etc.)
```

# phenotype-go-sdk

Phenotype-org Go SDK — consolidates Go Kit/SDK packages from the KooshaPari org.

## Packages

| Path | Source | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| \packages/devhex\ | [DevHex](https://github.com/KooshaPari/DevHex) | Hexagonal Go library for dev environment abstractions (module `github.com/KooshaPari/devenv-abstraction`). The single canonical Go module in the workspace. |
| \packages/platformkit\ | [PlatformKit](https://github.com/KooshaPari/PlatformKit) | Docs/specs only. Its Go code (`go/devenv`, `go/devhex`) was a broken duplicate of `devhex` and was removed (see Workspace notes). |
| \packages/mcpkit\ | [McpKit](https://github.com/KooshaPari/McpKit) | MCP framework SDK (Go workspace) — deferred (see notes). |

Use `go work sync` from the repo root to build across packages.

## Workspace notes

- `go.work` includes only `packages/devhex` — it builds and tests clean and is
  the single source of the devenv/devhex modules.
- The two duplicate copies under `packages/platformkit/go/` were **removed**
  (2026-06-02, ADR-011 Go convergence): `platformkit/go/devhex` was a
  byte-divergent dup of `packages/devhex` claiming the same module path, and
  `platformkit/go/devenv` was an older lowercase-path copy that did not compile.
- `packages/mcpkit/go/go.work` references missing `pheno-mcp-*` modules — Go MCP
  packages deferred until restored.

Essential utilities and foundational crates for the Phenotype ecosystem. Provides CLI shells, filesystem abstractions, cryptographic operations, network utilities, and testing helpers used across all Phenotype services and tools.

## Overview

**PhenoUtils** is the foundational utilities library for the Phenotype platform, providing battle-tested implementations of common patterns: interactive shells, filesystem abstractions with async support, cryptographic operations, network utilities, and comprehensive testing helpers. All crates are zero-dependency where possible, thoroughly tested, and designed for high-performance, production use.

**Core Mission**: Eliminate utility boilerplate across Phenotype services by providing reusable, well-tested foundational crates that handle complexity transparently.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Rust (edition 2021)
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio for async filesystem and network operations
- **Cryptography**: ring for cryptographic primitives, argon2 for password hashing
- **Testing**: criterion for benchmarking, proptest for property testing
- **Build**: Cargo workspace with shared dependency versions

## Key Features

- **CLI Shell Framework**: Interactive shell builder with command parsing, completions, history
- **Filesystem Utilities**: Async file I/O, recursive operations, atomic writes, path utilities
- **Cryptographic Operations**: Hashing, encryption, signing, HMAC, key derivation
- **Network Utilities**: TCP/UDP helpers, connection pooling, DNS resolution, TLS support
- **Testing Helpers**: Fixtures, temporary files/directories, mock implementations, property generators
- **Error Handling**: Rich error types with context, automatic `?` operator support
- **Performance**: Zero-copy where possible, memory pooling, efficient string handling

Canonical home for Phenotype-org infrastructure-as-code, architectural decision records (ADRs), specifications, and operational runbooks. Supports the **7-node hybrid compute mesh** spanning Oracle Cloud, GCP, AWS, Cloudflare, and a Tailscale-attached home desktop.

## Overview

`phenotype-infra` is the single source of truth for:

- **Network topology** — Tailscale-based control plane across 7 nodes (OCI primary/secondary, GCP e2-micro, AWS Lambda webhooks, Cloudflare Workers/Tunnel, home Mac runner, and a Hetzner spillover reserved for Phase 2).
- **Runner routing** — Forgejo + Woodpecker CI with label-based dispatch (`[self-hosted, heavy, home]` vs `[self-hosted, oci]`).
- **Credential management** — Vaultwarden as canonical credential store, rotation policy documented in `docs/governance/security-policy.md`.
- **Rollback kill-switch** — Every node has a documented path back to GitHub Actions / disable procedure.

## Quick-start

```bash
# 1. Clone + read the topology
git clone git@github.com:KooshaPari/phenotype-infra.git
cd phenotype-infra
cat docs/specs/compute-mesh-spec.md

# 2. Read the top ADRs in order
ls docs/adr/

# 3. Bring up OCI primary (Day-1)
cat docs/runbooks/day1-oci-first-light.md

# 4. Register home-desktop runner (Day-1)
cat docs/runbooks/day1-home-runner-setup.md
```

## Operational status (2026-04-24)

- **Windows desktop heavy runner** — operational. Service `actions.runner.KooshaPari-phenotype-tooling.desktop-kooshapari-desk` registered and idle on the home Mac. Install procedure (with the gotchas that surfaced live: em-dash → ASCII, alphanumeric password, 48-char Description cap, unquoted `-OrgUrl`) is captured in `docs/runbooks/windows-desktop-runner.md`. Parsec coexistence verified: runner service stays in `Manual` start, only triggered on dispatch.
- Credential for the local `runneruser` account is stored in Vaultwarden under `windows-runner/desktop-kooshapari-desk/runneruser`.
- See `docs/runbooks/windows-desktop-runner.md` for verification, tear-down, and replacement steps.

## Contribution rules

- **No secrets.** Every credential is a placeholder (`<OCI_TENANCY_OCID>`, `<TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY>`, etc.). Real values live in Vaultwarden and are injected at runtime.
- **Terraform apply is human-only.** Agents may `terraform plan` and open PRs; `apply` requires explicit user approval.
- **ADR-first.** Any topology change needs an ADR before the IaC change.
- **Runbook-first.** Any node addition needs a runbook before the IaC scaffold.
- **Scripting hierarchy** (per `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`): Rust default; Zig/Mojo/Go with one-line justification; Bash only as ≤5-line glue with justification comment. Terraform/Ansible/YAML are exempt as domain tools.

# Agent DevOps Setups

**STATUS: DEPRECATED — see DEPRECATION.md**

[![AI Slop Inside](https://sladge.net/badge.svg)](https://sladge.net)

This repo is the shared configuration fabric for multi-model agent tooling in the Phenotype
organization: policy federation, harness-specific overlays, task-domain scopes, and extension
runtime hooks for `Codex`, `Cursor-agent`, `Claude`, and `Factory-Droid`.

This repository is superseded by **phenoShared** and is maintained as read-only reference. No new development.

## Problem this solves

Current agent-level toolchains each support their own local override surfaces (`AGENTS.md`,
`CLAUDE.md`, `Cursor` rules, harness flags, etc.), which leads to drift.
This repository unifies those concerns by:

- Defining precedence-aware policy layers,
- Normalizing extension configuration across harnesses,
- Recording all decisions and merges in auditable artifacts.

## Directory layout

├── docs/               # audit notes and architecture docs
└── .github/workflows/  # optional validation/refresh automation
```

## Policy resolution model

Default layer order (low → high precedence):

1. `system` (org-wide defaults)
2. `user` (operator role overrides)
3. `harness` (tooling-specific behavior)
4. `repo` (repository-specific controls)
5. `task-domain` (domain-specific contracts)
6. `extensions` (explicitly selected extension packs)

Higher layers override keys from lower layers.

## Usage

```bash
# Build effective policy for a specific context
python tools/federate_policy.py \
  --repo agent-devops-setups \
  --harness codex \
  --user core-operator \
  --task-domain agentops \
  --extensions codex-gate,agentops-ci \
  --out /tmp/effective-policy.json

# Apply a policy payload into the repository path for local tooling
bash tools/sync_policy.sh \
  --repo-root /Users/kooshapari/CodeProjects/Phenotype/repos/thegent \
  --payload /tmp/effective-policy.json \
  --mode write

# Batch onboarding
bash tools/onboard_repos.sh \
  --harness codex \
  --task-domain agentops \
  --extensions codex-gate,agentops-ci \
  --user core-operator \
  --repo-list thegent,template-commons,portage,heliosCLI,cliproxyapi++,agentapi-plusplus

# Matrix onboarding (harness + task-domain)
bash tools/matrix_onboard.sh \
  --harnesses "codex,cursor-agent,claude,factory-droid" \
  --task-domains "agentops,devops" \
  --repo-list thegent,template-commons,portage,heliosCLI,cliproxyapi++,agentapi-plusplus

# Make targets
make help
make policy-sync        # codex + agentops full list
make policy-matrix      # matrix across harnesses and domains
make policy-matrix-dry  # same matrix in dry-run mode
```

## Expected outputs

- `effective_policy`: merged JSON object with all active policy keys.
- `applied_layers`: exact list of layer files used.
- `audit`: deterministic trace for forensics and review.

## Governance goals

- No silent precedence changes.
- No hidden defaults for critical controls.
- Full traceability from base policy to final resolved policy.
- Additive extension system that can be disabled by removing an extension manifest.

## Related tooling

- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` generation for repo surfaces.
- Harness hook policy (`extensions/hooks`).
- CI policy validation and PR gate gating via `.github/workflows`.

## Shared DevOps Helpers

Repository-level automation scripts live in `scripts/` and are consumed by
Phenotype repos that need consistent publish/checker behavior.

- `scripts/repo-push-fallback.sh`:
  publish helper with a primary remote first and local/remote fallback.
- `scripts/repo-devops-checker.sh`:
  lightweight DevOps gate checks for git health and optional `task ci` execution.

Recommended invocation pattern from a repo checkout:

```bash
# Optional override if repo layout differs from ../agent-devops-setups
export PHENOTYPE_DEVOPS_REPO_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/agent-devops-setups

# Optional per-command overrides
export PHENOTYPE_DEVOPS_PUSH_HELPER=$PHENOTYPE_DEVOPS_REPO_ROOT/scripts/repo-push-fallback.sh
export PHENOTYPE_DEVOPS_CHECKER_HELPER=$PHENOTYPE_DEVOPS_REPO_ROOT/scripts/repo-devops-checker.sh

bash /absolute/path/to/your/repo/scripts/push-heliosapp-with-fallback.sh
bash /absolute/path/to/your/repo/scripts/devops-checker.sh --check-ci --emit-summary
```

Because each repo may wire flags and defaults differently, keep a small local
wrapper script that forwards into these shared scripts with repo-local defaults.

## Validation commands

```bash
# Validate generated policy payload against schemas
python tools/validate_policy_payload.py \
  --payload /tmp/effective-policy.json \
  --policy-schema schemas/policy-resolution.schema.json \
  --manifest-schema schemas/extension-manifest.schema.json \
  --manifest-dir extensions/manifests \
  --strict
```

## Signing and rotation audit

```bash
# Emit signed policy payload
python tools/federate_policy.py \
  --repo thegent \
  --harness codex \
  --user core-operator \
  --task-domain agentops \
  --extensions codex-gate \
  --sign-key "$AGENT_POLICY_HMAC_KEY" \
  --out /tmp/effective-policy.json

# Verify signed payload
python tools/validate_policy_payload.py \
  --payload /tmp/effective-policy.json \
  --sign-key "$AGENT_POLICY_HMAC_KEY" \
  --strict

# Track rotation across repos
python tools/audit_policy_rotation.py \
  --repo-list thegent,template-commons,heliosCLI \
  --repo-root /Users/kooshapari/CodeProjects/Phenotype/repos \
  --state /tmp/policy-rotation-state.json \
  --out /tmp/policy-rotation-report.json

# Build PR package
python tools/build_pr_package.py
```
# phenotype-dep-guard

Malicious dependency analysis and supply chain security guard.

## Layer Contract

- layer_type: security_ops
- layer_name: phenotype-dep-guard
- versioning: semver

## Mission

Analyze direct and transitive dependencies for malicious code, vulnerabilities, and anomalous behavior.

1. High-velocity multi-source dependency resolution.
2. Heuristic and static triage (AST parsing, .pth/setup.py scanning).
3. Agentic LLM deep analysis (minimax-m2.7-highspeed, gpt-5-mini).
4. Reporting and alerting.

## Spec Kitty Workflow

```bash
spec-kitty research --feature layered-template-platform --force
```

Primary feature workspace:

- `kitty-specs/layered-template-platform/`

## Operational Workflow

1. Run `task check` before release.
2. Keep manifest/reconcile files aligned for any contract-affecting change.
3. Run `task release:prep` as final pre-release gate.

## Outputs

- Layer contract specs
- WP DAG and execution lanes
- Reconcile contract and acceptance criteria
# phenotype-org-audits

Central inventory and metrics hub for the Phenotype organization. Comprehensive audit-history tracking across **165 unique repositories** (48 local + 94 GitHub-only + 23 local-only), with quarterly refresh baseline and systemic-issue governance.

## Purpose

This repository serves as the canonical archive for:
- **Authoritative inventory** — 165-repo master registry (GitHub + local)
- **Quarterly audits** — Organization-wide scans (LOC, dependencies, complexity, governance adoption)
- **Systemic issues** — Cross-repo duplication, build failures, policy gaps, archived-code salvage opportunities
- **Governance velocity** — Adoption rate of CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, AgilePlus integration, test coverage
- **Longitudinal trends** — Drift in LOC, tech stack changes, architectural decisions
- **Coverage metrics** — Test coverage, spec traceability, quality gate compliance

## Repository Inventory

**TOTAL REPOS TRACKED**: 165 unique repositories

| Category | Count | Details |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Local + GitHub (cloned) | 48 | Active + archived mix |
| GitHub only (not cloned) | 94 | Can be fetched on-demand |
| Local only (no remote) | 12 | Self-contained worktrees |
| Archived on GitHub | 63 | Frozen; salvage candidates mapped |

**Status by Location**:
- ✅ Local + GitHub: 48 repos (primary development)
- 🔗 GitHub only: 94 repos (integrated, not cloned)
- 📦 Local only: 12 repos (internal tools)
- 🗃️ Archived: 63 repos (frozen, 29 have salvage candidates in `inventory/deleted_traces.md`)

See `inventory/AUTHORITATIVE_REPO_INVENTORY.md` for full registry.

## Quarterly Audit Schedule

Audits run automatically via GitHub Actions CI on:
- **Q1**: 1st January, 9am ET
- **Q2**: 1st April, 9am ET
- **Q3**: 1st July, 9am ET
- **Q4**: 1st October, 9am ET

**Cron**: `0 14 1 1,4,7,10 *`

**Refresh Policy**:
- Inventory refreshed: Before each quarterly audit + ad-hoc when new repos detected
- Metrics updated: Each audit run
- Use `tooling/inventory-refresh.sh` to re-run authoritative scan

## Retention Policy

- **Current quarter**: Full detail (all artifacts preserved)
- **Past 4 quarters**: Summary only (INDEX.md + SYSTEMIC_ISSUES.md)
- **Older than 1 year**: Archived to `.archive/` (monthly pruning)

## Metrics Reference

Where to find each metric:

| Metric | Location | Updated | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|
| Test coverage | `metrics/COVERAGE_V3.md` | Quarterly | Track coverage baseline across 165 repos |
| Systemic issues | `metrics/SYSTEMIC_ISSUES.md` | Quarterly | Cross-org patterns, gaps, policy violations |
| Quality uplift | `metrics/UPLIFT_REPORT.md` | Quarterly | Improvement trends (LOC reduction, complexity) |
| Dependency alignment | `audits/<YYYY-MM-DD>/full_dep_matrix.md` | Each audit | Version alignment gaps, security advisories |
| Governance adoption | `audits/<YYYY-MM-DD>/governance_adoption.md` | Each audit | CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, AgilePlus coverage % |
| FR traceability | `audits/<YYYY-MM-DD>/fr_scaffolding.md` | Each audit | Test-first compliance, spec coverage |

## Governance Integration

- **AgilePlus**: Systemic issues feed `eco-NNN` specs; governance gaps inform policy updates
- **Worklogs**: Cross-project duplication findings → `worklogs/DUPLICATION.md`
- **Test scaffolding**: FR traceability → test-first mandate validation
- **Dependency waves**: Version alignment snapshots → quarterly version-bump waves
- **Archived repos**: Salvage candidates (`inventory/deleted_traces.md`) → extraction planning

## Refresh Inventory (Agent-Driven)

To re-run the authoritative inventory scan:

```bash
cd /Users/kooshapari/CodeProjects/Phenotype/repos/phenotype-org-audits
./tooling/inventory-refresh.sh
```

This triggers the inventory agent to rescan GitHub + local repos and update:
- `inventory/AUTHORITATIVE_REPO_INVENTORY.md`
- `inventory/github_remote_inventory.md`

# phenotype-bus

## Overview

`phenotype-bus` is archived. The live absorb target is
[`phenoEvents`](https://github.com/KooshaPari/phenoEvents), which carries the
EventBus port and the lifted in-memory bus adapter.

Historical `phenotype-bus` provided a strongly-typed, tokio-based event bus for
loose coupling between Phenotype named collections:

- **Sidekick** — agent dispatch & messaging
- **Eidolon** — device automation (desktop, mobile, sandbox)
- **Observably** — distributed tracing & logging
- **Stashly** — state, events, caching
- **Paginary** — pagination & pagination metadata

## Usage

Use `phenoEvents` for new code. The example below is retained only to describe
the archived API surface that was absorbed.

```rust
use phenotype_bus::{Bus, Event};
use serde::Serialize;

#[derive(Clone, Serialize)]
struct UserStatusChanged {
    user_id: String,
    online: bool,
}

impl Event for UserStatusChanged {
    fn event_name(&self) -> &'static str {
        "UserStatusChanged"
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let bus = Bus::new(100);
    let mut rx = bus.subscribe();

    let publisher = {
        let bus = bus.clone();
        tokio::spawn(async move {
            let event = UserStatusChanged {
                user_id: "user-123".into(),
                online: true,
            };

            bus.publish(event).await
        })
    };

    let event = rx.recv().await?;
    println!("Received: {}", event.event_name());

    publisher.await??;

    Ok(())
}
```

## API

### `Bus<E: Event>`

- **`new(capacity: usize)`** - Create a new bus with the specified broadcast channel capacity
- **`publish(event: E) -> Result<(), BusError>`** - Publish an event to all current subscribers
- **`subscribe() -> broadcast::Receiver<Arc<E>>`** - Subscribe to the event stream
- **`receiver_count() -> usize`** - Return the current broadcast receiver count

### `Event` Trait

Implement `Event` for any type that is `Send + Sync + 'static + Serialize`:

```rust
impl Event for MyEvent {
    fn event_name(&self) -> &'static str {
        "MyEvent"
    }
}
```

## Implementation

- **155 LOC** (lib.rs + tests)
- **12 tests** (3 unit + 7 cross-collection integration + 2 smoke)
- **Async first**: built on `tokio::sync::broadcast`
- **Type-safe**: Generic trait bounds enforce compile-time correctness
- **Zero dependencies** beyond standard Phenotype stack (tokio, serde, thiserror)
- **Clone-safe**: `Bus<E>` is cheaply cloneable via `Arc`

## Behavior

### Back-Pressure

The bus is backed by `tokio::sync::broadcast`. That means each subscriber has its own cursor into a bounded ring buffer.

- Slow subscribers can fall behind if the buffer fills.
- When that happens, `broadcast::Receiver::recv()` returns `Err(tokio::sync::broadcast::error::RecvError::Lagged(_))`.
- This is intentional: lag is surfaced to the caller instead of being hidden.

### Publish Before Subscribe

Events are not persisted. If you call `publish()` before any subscriber exists, the event is dropped and will not be replayed to future subscribers.

- Late subscribers only see events published after they subscribe.
- If you need history or replay, use `phenoEvents` or add persistence in the
  target event domain.

## Cross-Collection Integration

New collection integrations should depend on the event-domain owner, not on
archived `phenotype-bus`:

```toml
[dependencies]
pheno-events = { git = "https://github.com/KooshaPari/phenoEvents", branch = "main" }
```

Events are identified by type, so no event registry is needed. Collections are loosely coupled:

- **Sidekick** publishes `DispatchEvent` → **Eidolon** subscribes
- **Observably** publishes `TraceEvent` → **Stashly** subscribes for event sourcing
- **Paginary** publishes `PaginationEvent` → **Observably** logs for tracing

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Rust (Edition 2021)
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio (broadcast channels)
- **Serialization**: Serde (JSON, bincode)
- **Error Handling**: thiserror with custom `BusError` type
- **Testing**: Inline unit tests + integration tests

## Key Design Decisions

- **Broadcast Channels**: Uses Tokio's built-in broadcast for efficient one-to-many delivery
- **Type-Safe Events**: Generic `Bus<E: Event>` enforces compile-time type safety
- **No Registry**: Event routing is implicit via Rust type system (no string-based registry)
- **Zero-Copy on Arc**: Events are wrapped in `Arc<E>` for efficient sharing
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only Tokio, Serde, and Thiserror as external deps
- **Clone-friendly**: Bus itself is cheaply cloneable for spawning tasks

## Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Specification |
|--------|---------------|
| **Publish latency** | <1μs per subscriber (broadcast channel backed) |
| **Memory overhead** | ~32 bytes per active subscriber |
| **Throughput** | Depends on Event size; tested with 100+ subscribers |
| **Channel capacity** | Configurable; default 100 events buffered |

## Related Phenotype Projects

- **Sidekick** — Agent dispatch system; historical `phenotype-bus` consumer
- **Eidolon** — Device automation; historical automation event publisher
- **Observably** — Tracing platform; stale CI dependency removed in PhenoObservability `37d1ee0`
- **Stashly** — State/event caching; event sourcing belongs in the event/resilience owners
- **Paginary** — Pagination metadata; no new dependency on archived `phenotype-bus`

## Quick Examples

### Publish & Subscribe

```rust
use phenotype_bus::{Bus, Event};
use serde::Serialize;

#[derive(Clone, Serialize)]
struct AppStarted {
    version: String,
}

impl Event for AppStarted {
    fn event_name(&self) -> &'static str {
        "AppStarted"
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let bus = Bus::new(100);
    let mut rx = bus.subscribe();

    bus.publish(AppStarted {
        version: "1.0".into(),
    })
    .await?;

    let event = rx.recv().await?;
    println!("Subscriber got: {}", event.event_name());

    Ok(())
}
```

### Multiple Event Types

```rust
use phenotype_bus::Event;
use serde::Serialize;

#[derive(Clone, Serialize)]
struct AppStarted {
    version: String,
}

#[derive(Clone, Serialize)]
struct AppShutdown {
    reason: String,
}

#[derive(Clone, Serialize)]
enum SystemEvent {
    Startup(AppStarted),
    Shutdown(AppShutdown),
}

impl Event for SystemEvent {
    fn event_name(&self) -> &'static str {
        match self {
            SystemEvent::Startup(_) => "Startup",
            SystemEvent::Shutdown(_) => "Shutdown",
        }
    }
}

## Running Tests

Run the workspace test suite from the repository root:

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

For this crate, the current suite covers unit tests, edge cases for back-pressure and publish-before-subscribe behavior, and cross-collection integration tests.

# PhenoKits

**The Phenotype org's umbrella checkout and shared-artifact monorepo.**

## What is this?

PhenoKits plays two related roles, which is the source of common confusion:

1. **Umbrella checkout (parent directory).** When you clone the full Phenotype workspace, `PhenoKits/` is the parent directory that holds ~30 sibling repos (AgilePlus, heliosApp, thegent, Civis, bifrost, etc.) as subdirectories so cross-cutting agents and humans can do org-wide work in one tree. In that role, PhenoKits is **not a project** — it is the workspace root.
2. **Shared-artifact monorepo (this repository).** Independently, `KooshaPari/PhenoKits` is a real git repo containing 12 categories of shared, cross-org artifacts (templates, configs, libs, governance, security, etc.) that every Phenotype project consumes.

In addition, **`HexaKit/`** inside this repo is a **sub-monorepo** included as a git submodule — a separate template/registry workspace, not a sibling subdir.

If you only see this single repo in isolation, you are looking at role (2): the shared-artifact monorepo. The umbrella role (1) only exists when this repo is checked out alongside the rest of the Phenotype org.

## Overview

PhenoKits-the-monorepo organizes artifacts into 12 distinct categories, each with clear mutability rules and agent interaction patterns.

## Categories

| # | Category | Purpose | Mutability |
|---|----------|---------|------------|
| 1 | [`templates/`](templates/) | Scaffolding for new projects | Editable |
| 2 | [`configs/`](configs/) | Parameterized configs | Parameters only |
| 3 | [`libs/`](libs/) | Multi-language libraries | Import/extend |
| 4 | [`secrets/`](secrets/) | Secret management patterns | Locked |
| 5 | [`governance/`](governance/) | ADRs, RFCs, standards | Varies |
| 6 | [`security/`](security/) | Scanning, policies, hardening | Locked |
| 7 | [`observability/`](observability/) | Logging, metrics, tracing | Configurable |
| 8 | [`docs/`](docs/) | API docs, runbooks, guides | Editable |
| 9 | [`scripts/`](scripts/) | Build, release, quality scripts | Executable |
| 10 | [`schemas/`](schemas/) | Type definitions, API specs | Locked |
| 11 | [`policies/`](policies/) | OPA, GitHub, compliance | Enforced |
| 12 | [`credentials/`](credentials/) | Auth configs, patterns | Locked |

## Bundled Kits

These are the buildable / structured kits available inside or alongside this repo.

| Kit | Location | Type | Notes |
|-----|----------|------|-------|
| HexaKit | [`HexaKit/`](HexaKit/) | **Sub-monorepo (git submodule)** | Hexagonal-architecture template CLI + registry. Has its own Cargo workspace; build from inside `HexaKit/`. |
| Civis | [`KooshaPari/Civis`](https://github.com/KooshaPari/Civis) | Sibling repo | Deterministic simulation and policy-driven architecture workspace. Cloned as a sibling at the umbrella level, not embedded here. |
| Hexagon | [`hexagon/`](hexagon/) | In-repo directory | Hexagonal artifacts curated alongside the kits. |

> Removed from prior docs: `PhenoLibs` row — that kit does not exist in this repo. Use [`libs/`](libs/) for multi-language library artifacts instead.

## Quick Reference

### Agent Interaction Matrix

| Category | Agent Observes | Agent Mutates | Agent Validates |
|----------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Templates | Yes | Instantiated outputs only | No |
| Configs | Yes | Parameters only | Yes (validation) |
| Libs | Yes | No, except generated wrappers | No |
| Secrets | References and metadata only | No | Yes (scanning) |
| Governance | Yes | Yes (ADRs) | No |
| Security | Yes | Yes | Yes (scanning) |
| Observability | Yes | Yes (configs/dashboards) | Yes (monitoring) |
| Docs | Yes | Yes | No |
| Scripts | Yes | Yes | No |
| Schemas | Yes | Yes (code gen) | Yes (type checking) |
| Policies | Yes | Yes | Yes (OPA, gates) |
| Credentials | Broker state only | No | Yes (rotation/expiry checks) |

This matrix describes permission boundaries, not broad technical capability.
Agents should never read or write raw secret or credential material; they may
reference vault handles, metadata, rotation status, and validation results.

## Quick Start

### Clone with the HexaKit sub-monorepo

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/KooshaPari/PhenoKits.git
cd PhenoKits
# If you forgot --recurse-submodules:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Build the HexaKit sub-monorepo

The repo root's `Cargo.toml` declares `members = []` (it intentionally excludes
`HexaKit/` and the language-specific `libs/*` workspaces). To build buildable
Rust code, enter the relevant sub-workspace:

```bash
# Build HexaKit (sub-monorepo Cargo workspace)
cd HexaKit && cargo build

# Or build the Rust libs sub-workspace
cd libs/rust && cargo build
```

### For Agents

```bash
# Read agent patterns
cat docs/AGENT_PATTERNS.md

# Apply a config
python3 scripts/utility/parameterize.py \
    configs/params.example.json \
    configs/cicd/github-actions/ci.yml
```

### For Developers

```bash
# Apply org configs
cp -r configs/tooling/pre-commit/* .git/hooks/

# Set up CI
cp configs/cicd/github-actions/* .github/workflows/

# Configure observability
cp configs/observability/prometheus.yml ./
```
