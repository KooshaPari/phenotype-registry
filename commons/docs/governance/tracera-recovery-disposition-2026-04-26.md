# Tracera Recovery Disposition - 2026-04-26

## Purpose

This closes `SUNSET-011B`: create a live-main recovery branch for the
`Tracera-recovered` commits if any are still needed.

## Decision

No Tracera code PR is required for the direct workflow recovery commits.

A fresh clone of `KooshaPari/Tracera` at live `main`
`5695f3984d31cde4cbc140219eada971b5ed8a40` accepted both recovered workflow
patches with `git am --3way`, but each reported `No changes -- Patch already
applied`. That means the two safe direct recovery commits are already present
on live `main`.

## Commit Disposition

| Commit | Subject | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `bcf56fea` | `ci: repair invalid workflow syntax` | Already represented on live `main`; no PR. |
| `d7d68840` | `ci: scope legacy broad workflows` | Already represented on live `main`; no PR. |
| `048a9699` | `chore(ci): adopt phenotype-tooling workflows (wave-2)` | Skip. It adds placeholder/echo-style workflows and weak gates. |
| `8873600b` | `feat(tracera): tracertm.cli stub with all command modules` | Defer/rework. It commits `__pycache__` binaries and shallow stubs; salvage only through a clean CLI implementation PR. |
| `19e9a9ab` | `docs(worklog): bootstrap worklog scaffolding (org-wide gap closure)` | Skip/rework. Root `worklogs/` is shelf-style; use Tracera-owned `docs/sessions/` or canonical docs instead. |
| `f9123258` | `chore: add MIT LICENSE and update README` | Skip/rework. Live `main` already uses `LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSE-APACHE`; license changes need an explicit legal/product decision. |

## Validation Evidence

Commands run in `/tmp/tracera-fresh-compare.5jNnUP/Tracera`:

```bash
git switch -c codex/recover-workflow-repairs-20260426 origin/main
git am --3way /tmp/bcf56fea.patch /tmp/d7d68840.patch
```

Result:

```text
Applying: ci: repair invalid workflow syntax
No changes -- Patch already applied.
Applying: ci: scope legacy broad workflows
No changes -- Patch already applied.
```

Additional checks:

```bash
actionlint .github/workflows/ci.yml \
  .github/workflows/contracts.yml \
  .github/workflows/test-validation.yml
```

`actionlint` found no YAML parse failure from the recovered commits, but it did
report pre-existing workflow hygiene issues: old `actions/cache@v3`,
`actions/setup-go@v4`, `actions/setup-python@v4`, and shell quoting warnings.
Those are current Tracera CI hardening work, not recovery-port work.

## Follow-Up

Create a separate Tracera PR for actionlint hygiene if Tracera CI hardening
becomes the next active lane. Keep it scoped to current live workflows; do not
cherry-pick stale recovered workflow or license commits wholesale.

## SUNSET-011B Status

Complete. No Tracera PR opened because the only directly safe recovery commits
were already present on live `main`.
