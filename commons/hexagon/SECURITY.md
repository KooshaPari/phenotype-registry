## Security Best Practices

### For Template Users

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use `go mod`, `cargo audit`, etc.
   - Review security advisories

2. **Secrets Management**:
   - Never commit secrets to templates
   - Use environment variables
   - Employ secret management services

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all inputs at boundaries
   - Use domain validation
   - Sanitize external data

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Don't expose sensitive information in errors
   - Log security events
   - Use structured error handling

### For Template Contributors

1. **No Hardcoded Secrets**:
   - No API keys in templates
   - No default passwords
   - No certificate files

2. **Secure Defaults**:
   - Enable security features by default
   - Disable dangerous features
   - Document security considerations

3. **Supply Chain**:
   - Minimal dependencies
   - Vetted dependencies only
   - SBOM generation

4. **Generated Code**:
   - Security-focused patterns
   - OWASP Top 10 awareness
   - Input validation examples
