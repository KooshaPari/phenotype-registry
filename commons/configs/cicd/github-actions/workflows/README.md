# GitHub Workflow Templates

Centralized CI/CD workflow **copy-source examples** for Phenotype projects.

> **Canonical reusables live elsewhere — do not treat these as the source of truth.**
> For the org's federated governance checks, `uses:` the canonical reusable
> workflows directly rather than copying the templates here (which can drift):
> - **cargo-deny** (mechanism): `KooshaPari/phenotype-tooling/.github/workflows/reusable/cargo-deny.yml@main`
>   — its policy baseline (`deny.toml`) is owned by `phenotype-org-governance` (the enforcement repo).
> - **trufflehog** (mechanism): `KooshaPari/phenotype-tooling/.github/workflows/reusable-trufflehog.yml@main`.
> The files in this directory are *starting-point examples* for repos that need a
> bespoke pipeline — they are not live workflows (this is a `configs/` tree, not
> `.github/workflows/`) and they are not the federated source of truth.

## Usage

Prefer referencing the canonical reusables above. These templates are for
copy-and-adapt when a repo needs a bespoke pipeline.

  quality:
    uses: KooshaPari/template-commons/.github/workflows/quality-gate.yml@main
```

## Template Details

### quality-gate.yml

Runs on every push/PR:
- Format check (cargo fmt / ruff format)
- Lint check (clippy / ruff)
- Tests (cargo test / pytest)
- Security audit (cargo audit / pip-audit)

### release-template.yml

Runs manually via `workflow_dispatch`:
- Validates version format
- Publishes Rust crates to crates.io
- Publishes Python packages to PyPI
- Creates GitHub release with changelog

Inputs:
- `version`: Version to release (e.g., v1.0.0)
- `dry_run`: Dry run mode (default: false)

### security-template.yml

Runs on:
- Manual trigger
- Daily schedule (2 AM UTC)
- Every push to main
- Every PR

Checks:
- Rust: cargo-audit, cargo-deny
- Python: pip-audit, safety
- SAST: Semgrep, Trivy
- Secrets: gitleaks

### benchmark-template.yml

Runs on:
- Manual trigger
- Every push to main
- Every PR to main

Features:
- Runs benchmarks
- Uploads results as artifacts
- Compares with main branch on PRs
- Comments on PR with results

## Environment Variables

All templates support these environment variables:

```yaml
env:
  RUST_BACKTRACE: 1
  CARGO_TERM_COLOR: always
```

## Permissions

Templates request minimal permissions:
- `contents: read` - For checkout
- `security-events: write` - For SARIF uploads
- `id-token: write` - For OIDC publishing (release only)
- `contents: write` - For releases only
