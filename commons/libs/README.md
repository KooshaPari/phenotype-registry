# Libraries

Runtime libraries were removed from `phenokits-commons` on 2026-06-20 to keep this repository scoped to governance, templates, policies, docs, and shared artifact patterns.

Absorbed homes:

- Go libs: `KooshaPari/phenotype-go-sdk` PR #21
- Python `phenokit-config-kit`: `KooshaPari/phenotype-python-sdk` PR #28
- Python libs already equivalent in `KooshaPari/phenotype-python-sdk`
- TypeScript libs: preserved in `KooshaPari/phenotype-registry` under `docs/absorption/PhenoKits/typescript-preservation/`

Do not add runtime package implementations here. Use a tight SDK/package repo instead.
