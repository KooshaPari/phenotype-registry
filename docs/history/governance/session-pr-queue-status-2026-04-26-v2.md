## Discrepancies vs. Earlier Audit

The earlier audit (v1) captured only 5 PRs. This v2 audit:
- **Added 11 new PRs** that were opened/known in the session but not previously audited
- **Confirmed 5 PRs from v1** (all details align)
- **Updated PR states** that have changed (e.g., several were merged after v1 was written)
- **Correct total:** 16 PRs in this session, not 5
