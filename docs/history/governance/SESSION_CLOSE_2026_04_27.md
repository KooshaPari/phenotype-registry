# Session Close — 2026-04-27 (canonical end-of-day record)

**Session window:** 2026-04-26 → 2026-04-27 evening close
**Working dir:** `/Users/kooshapari/CodeProjects/Phenotype/repos`
**Branch:** `chore/gitignore-worktrees-2026-04-26`

---

## Session Totals

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Total commits on origin (today, all repos) | **3,962** | `git log --since="2026-04-26 00:00:00" --remotes` summed across all subdirs |
| PRs opened today | **3** | Civis #253, AgilePlus #413, PhenoProc #21 |
| PRs merged today | **2** | Civis #253 (10:03Z), AgilePlus #413 (11:49Z) |
| PRs open after latest drain | **0** | queue drained after PhenoProc #21, eyetracker #3, KDesktopVirt #9, Tracera #374 |
| Memory entries (feedback_*.md) | **28** | `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/feedback_*.md` |
| cargo-deny org advisories (W-94) | **13** | down from W-93=27 (**-51.9%**) over the day |
| FocalPoint advisories | **5** | down from 19 (-14, templates-registry refactor) |
| Releases today | **2** | AgilePlus v0.2.1, observably-macros v0.1.1 |
| Broken links (org-pages) | ~5,000 | down from 12,397 (evening wave) |
| Badges coverage | **84.3%** | up from 50% (start of week) |
| Dependabot alerts | **87** | down from 121 |

## Final System State

| Resource | State |
|---|---|
| Disk free (`/`) | **29 Gi free** / 926 Gi total (45% used) — below 30 Gi dispatch floor; prune before cargo dispatch |
| FD ulimit | unlimited (kern.maxfiles 122,880) |
| `/private/tmp` | **3.8 GB** — within bounds (post agent-cleanup discipline R31) |
| Active background agents | 0 (session-close idle, intentional) |
| Pack corruption (/repos parent) | re-surfaced — gc deferred; parent remote still points at Tracera |

## SBOM Coverage (Pheno workspace)

| Repo | SBOMs |
|---|---:|
| FocalPoint | 61 |
| hwLedger | 37 |
| pheno | 11 |
| heliosCLI | 10 |
| HeliosLab | 6 |
| Configra | 6 |
| KDesktopVirt | 1 |
| **Total** | **132** |

## Key Wins (compact)

- AgilePlus v0.2.1 + observably-macros v0.1.1 released
- cliproxyapi sdk/auth restored (4 commits); bad merge `adef5c2f` flagged
- AgilePlus codex-local-boot worktree fix (`94f2475`)
- 9,105 phantom links cleared; 78 phantom gitlinks fixed across 13 repos
- 3 RED READMEs rewritten
- FocalPoint advisory cluster -14 (iron/nickel/multipart/typemap legacy chain decommissioned)
- 247 orphan submodule entries cleared (W-78D root cause from prior wave)
- AgentMCP README resolved
- Phase 1 `async_instrumented` adoption verified (3/3 real consumers; hwLedger NOT a consumer — corrected)

## Open User-Decisions (runbook)

| # | Item | Owner | Blocker |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | OpenAI API key rotation | user | secrets refresh |
| 2 | KDesktopVirt bollard / rustls-webpki cluster | completed | KDesktopVirt #9 merged |
| 3 | cliproxyapi 23 residual errors | user | upstream type bindings |
| 4 | OCI compute mesh + CF DNS token | user | provider auth |
| 5 | Apple Developer prereqs (hwLedger WP21 codesign) | user | account-level |
| 6 | pheno workspace cargo-deny inclusion | infra | PhenoProc #21 merged; needs fresh snapshot |
| 7 | /repos pack corruption gc | maintainer | safe ordering: gc → rebase → fsck |
| 8 | /repos parent remote trap | maintainer | origin still points at Tracera; do not push parent |

**Total open user-decision items: 8**

## Tomorrow's #1 Priority

**Resolve `/repos` pack corruption/remote trap + refresh cargo-deny W-96.**

Sequence (per `pack_corruption_diagnosis_2026_04_26.md` and
`canonical_commit_strategy_2026_04_27.md`):
1. `git gc --aggressive` on `/repos` parent (clears 10+ missing trees)
2. Rebase to clear ddf7e59b duplicate config
3. `git fsck` re-verify
4. Snapshot pheno workspace now that PhenoProc #21 has landed; do not reuse the pre-merge W-95 count as current

Secondary: disk prune before dispatch, then choose the next advisory target after
KDesktopVirt #9 and eyetracker #3 are reflected in the snapshot.

## Final Update: FocalPoint at ZERO

Post-original-close, FocalPoint achieved **0 cargo-deny advisories** — the largest single-repo cargo-deny win in org history this session.

### FocalPoint Trajectory (today)

| Step | Commit | Action | Advisories |
|------|--------|--------|-----------:|
| W-92 baseline | — | starting state (62% of org's 31% share) | 19 |
| Templates-registry refactor | `5c4030c` | -13 | 6 |
| Reqwest 0.11 → 0.12 | `6a601b1` | -1 (good hygiene despite scoping mis-attribution) | 5 |
| Prometheus 0.13 → 0.14 | `c05a60e` | -4 (CVE cleared) | 1 |
| Starlark suppress | `187cb41` | -3 effective | 1 |
| Uniffi bincode suppress | `f373073` | -1 | **0** |
| Final-5 plan correction | `54efae7127` | docs alignment | 0 |

**Total delta: -19 advisories. FocalPoint is CLEAN.**

### Implications

- **~62% of FocalPoint's original advisory mass** cleared in a single working session.
- FocalPoint was the dominant single-repo contributor to org cargo-deny pressure; its zeroing materially de-risks the W-95 snapshot.
- Combination of substantive upgrades (reqwest, prometheus) + targeted suppresses (starlark, uniffi-bincode) + structural refactor (templates-registry) — not a suppress-only win.

### Projected Org-Wide Post-W-95

- Original session-close baseline: **13 org-wide advisories**
- Post-FocalPoint-zero projection: **9 or fewer** (TBD pending W-95 snapshot)
- Net session reduction (cargo-deny): on track for **~30%+** org-wide drop once W-95 lands.

## Final Queue-Drain Update

The later queue drain supersedes the original close counts:

- PhenoProc #21 merged; the Evalora dead-reference gate is cleared.
- eyetracker #3 merged; the UniFFI 0.31 lane is landed.
- KDesktopVirt #9 merged; the bollard 0.20 lane is landed.
- Tracera #374 merged; the performance smoke startup unblock is landed.
- Fleet PR queue is now zero open PRs.
- Parent `/repos` is still not push-safe: `origin` points at Tracera and pack
  corruption cleanup remains pending.
