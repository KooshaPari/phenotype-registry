# ORG_DASHBOARD v56 - Final-Final Closeout (2026-04-27)

**Predecessor:** [v55 session close](./ORG_DASHBOARD_v55_2026_04_27_session_close.md)
**Scope:** dashboard-only correction and closeout over the v55 addenda.
**Status:** Documentation snapshot only; no source changes in this dashboard window.

## Executive Delta

v56 is the final-final reconciliation pass over the late v55 closeout. It locks
in the corrected push count, records the FocalPoint zero-advisory finish, updates
the open-PR state, and captures the post-drain cargo-deny follow-up posture.

The biggest correction is that the earlier 53-58 pushed-repo estimates were high.
The definitive audit counted **49 repos pushed today** from canonical checkouts,
with 7 local-only repos and 2 partial-push repos still needing provenance review.

## Counters Table

| Metric | v55 | v56 | Delta / Note |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Repos pushed today | 53 claimed | **49 verified** | corrected by canonical per-repo audit |
| Repos with any today commit | n/a | **56** | local or remote |
| Local-only repos | n/a | **7** | AgentMCP, AgilePlus, argis-extensions, AtomsBot, chatta, GDK, helios-cli |
| Partial pushes | n/a | **2** | HeliosLab +3, thegent +2 |
| SBOMs generated | 132 | **132** | unchanged |
| Cargo-deny org advisories | 13 | **8 (W-95)** | post-FocalPoint-zero snapshot |
| FocalPoint advisories | 5 | **0** | zero-advisory invariant established |
| Open PRs | 1-2 | **0 true open** | queue drained after PhenoProc #21, eyetracker #3, KDesktopVirt #9, Tracera #374 |
| Disk free (`/`) | 39 GiB | **29 GiB live check** | below 30 GiB cargo dispatch floor |
| Pack corruption / remote trap | gc-blocked | **still blocked** | parent `/repos` origin still points at Tracera; push remains unsafe |

## Verified Closeout Items

- **FocalPoint cargo-deny is clean.** Live check returned `advisories ok`.
- **W-95 org snapshot is 8 advisories.** This is the post-FocalPoint-zero baseline
  for the next cargo-deny wave.
- **PR inventory is down to zero true open PRs.**
  - PhenoProc #21: merged; Evalora dead-reference gate cleared.
  - eyetracker #3: merged after scoped UniFFI 0.31 bump.
  - KDesktopVirt #9: merged after targeted Rust validation and inherited-gate attribution.
  - Tracera #374: merged after review-fix commits and inherited-gate attribution.
- **Push count corrected to 49 repos.** The earlier dashboard language should be
  read as superseded by
  [today_pushes_final_count_2026_04_27.md](../governance/today_pushes_final_count_2026_04_27.md).

## W-96 Completed Queue-Drain Targets

| Target | Advisory leverage | Current disposition |
|---|---:|---|
| KDesktopVirt `bollard` cluster | 4 / 8 | PR #9 merged; `cargo check --workspace`, `cargo test --lib`, and gate attribution completed |
| eyetracker `uniffi` cluster | 2 / 8 | PR #3 merged; bump limited to `crates/eyetracker-ffi/Cargo.toml` |

These two targets covered 6 of the 8 W-95 residual advisories before merge.
Because both landed, the next cargo-deny action should be a fresh org snapshot
before choosing another W-96 target.

## Superseded Claims

- "53+ repos pushed" and "58+ pushes" are superseded by the definitive **49
  pushed repos** audit.
- The FocalPoint reqwest 0.11 -> 0.12 scoping claim that it would clear 6
  advisories was wrong. The bump was hygiene-positive but advisory-neutral; the
  actual final advisories were cleared by prometheus, starlark, and uniffi-bincode
  actions.
- v55's "FocalPoint 5 residual" state is superseded by the zero-advisory close.

## Current Blockers

1. **Do not push `/repos` canonical yet.** The parent checkout is still on the
   Tracera remote and has pack-corruption/gc cleanup pending. This blocks safe
   push/PR for this dashboard doc from the parent repo.
2. **FocalPoint working tree is dirty** with generated FFI/SBOM artifacts from
   prior work; leave untouched.
