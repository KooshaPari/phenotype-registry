# Phenotype Org Dashboard — v54 (2026-04-26 late evening / post-restart)

**Snapshot**: Late-evening delta over [v53](./ORG_DASHBOARD_v53_2026_04_26.md). After v53 was written ~1h before the org usage limit, the post-restart wave continued through push rounds 6+7 + a 7a fast-forward batch, three provenance-split BytePort commits, a today's-commits push audit, two stale-ignore cleanups, 114 SBOM bootstraps, and ~16 GiB of disk reclaim from a tmp_pack purge + /tmp safe-prune. Total day push count crossed **48+ repos**, broken-link debt continued downward, and the agent-imessage hook log received a stopgap truncation (11.5 MB → 730 KB). Pure documentation commit — no source pushes in this dashboard window.

## What changed since v53 (one-paragraph)

Push rounds 6+7 sequenced cliproxyapi (30 commits forwarded), KDV ratatui, FocalPoint DTO cleanup + iOS_BUILD_STATUS, McpKit, agent-user-status, Paginary, and heliosApp; round 7a fast-forwarded DevHex/Httpora/nanovms. BytePort fully resolved with three provenance-separated commits (MODE 1/2/3) and credential `ILOVEKUSHPAPI` scrubbed; Civis PR #253 opened with README rebase using `--ours` (verify-then-write upstream pattern). Today's-commits push audit (5c7b9b1bbd) showed 42/53 fully pushed. Hook hygiene: agent-imessage stopgap truncated the log 11.5 MB → 730 KB (37c15cf89e). Two stale-ignore sweeps cleaned Configra (3) + AgilePlus (1). 114 SBOMs bootstrapped across four commits. Disk: tmp_pack purge +4.6 GB (f8a9c2d736), /tmp safe-prune +12 GB (99be14f3b3) → **+16 GiB total reclaim** with 36 GiB free. Cargo.lock heliosCLI cleanup (eef573e) landed, helios-cli rebase escalated (Strategy 1 recommended), argis-extensions escalated (Strategy C recommended). AtomsBot/chatta archived triage committed (fd2862f3cf), AgentMCP local README conflict cleaned (02c133b0f4), pheno autostash dropped clean, Tracera-recovered upstream linkage repaired. Memory updated: `feedback_fork_aware_readme` + extension to `reference_archived_repos_locked`.

## User-Decision Queue (final state — 2026-04-26 EOD)

**Canonical runbook**: `/repos/docs/governance/user_decisions_runbook_2026_04_26.md`

Carry-over from v53 plus newly escalated items:

| # | Item | State |
|---|------|-------|
| 1 | cliproxyapi cluster A+B (23 errors) | open — user decision required |
| 2 | agileplus-plugin-core 404 | open |
| 3 | AgilePlus README rebase against main | open |
| 4 | BytePort backend ownership | open (code-side resolved) |
| 5 | GDK quality-gate adoption | open |

## Tomorrow Priorities

1. **cliproxyapi cluster A+B decisions** — last 23 errors blocking
2. **helios-cli rebase Strategy 1** — execute on user approval
3. **argis-extensions Strategy C** — execute on user approval
4. **`/repos` pack corruption W-78D playbook** — verify workstate → gc → rebase → fsck → push
5. **agileplus-plugin-core 404** — create/restore or remove dep
6. **Civis PR #253** — review + merge
7. **agent-imessage real fix** — log truncation was stopgap; root-cause already audited (418d2eb881)

**Generated**: 2026-04-26 late evening | **Supersedes**: ORG_DASHBOARD_v53_2026_04_26.md | **Scope**: post-restart full delta + session-close

## Post-v54 Addendum (final session capture, ~30min after v54 freeze)

This addendum captures deltas that landed after v54 was written. v54 + this section = canonical session record (no v55 needed).

### Pushes (post-v54)
- **AgilePlus PR #413** — spec/013 cancelled marker landed.
- **FocalPoint** — non-FF rebase pushed (jsonwebtoken bump + Tier-2 CVE sweep).
- **KDV** — non-FF rebase pushed (jsonwebtoken bump + Tier-2 CVE sweep).
- **pheno workspace** — `e27ba2b` (9 phantom gitlinks cleared) + `2721e0ef3` (cache-adapter merge).
- **heliosCLI** — `b29c6f9` (dismiss alerts #51/#52 + ignore-file cleanup).
- **agent-imessage stopgap** — `37c15cf89e` (log 11.5MB → 730KB; root-cause still in 418d2eb881 backlog).
- **Round-8 retry** + KDV/FP non-FF rebase = 3 additional pushes.

**Pushed-repo count this session (cumulative)**: 31 (v54 baseline) + 8 (post-v54) = **39 pushes**.

### Numerical corrections
- **W-93 cargo-deny re-verify**: actual org total is **27 advisories** (not 29). vs W-92 baseline of 50 → **-46% (-23 advisories)**. v54's "-12.5%" delta was stale.
- **SBOMs**: 121 total (round-1 114 + round-2 7).
- **Org-pages**: corrected to **2/9 live** (memory entry was aspirational, now reconciled).

### New artifacts
- **FocalPoint 19-advisory triage doc** — templates-registry refactor identified as 41% leverage point (single change clears 8/19).
- **User-decisions runbook** refreshed: 16 items (4 resolved, 9 newly added, 3 carry-over).
- **Memory entries codified**: `feedback_fork_aware_readme` (verify upstream identity before describing forks), `reference_archived_repos_locked` extended.

### Final canonical numbers
- **Pushes**: 39 | **Releases**: 2 (AgilePlus v0.2.1, observably-macros 0.1.1)
- **Cargo-deny org**: 50 → **27 (-46%)**
- **Dependabot**: 121 → 87 (-28%)
- **Badges**: 50% → 84.3% | **Broken links**: 12,397 → ~5,000

### Takeaway
Post-v54 wave was cleanup + correction: rebases unblocked FocalPoint/KDV non-FF state, numerical recalibration (cargo-deny -46% not -12.5%, org-pages 2/9 not 9/9), and one stopgap (agent-imessage log truncation pending real fix). Memory now reconciled with reality.
