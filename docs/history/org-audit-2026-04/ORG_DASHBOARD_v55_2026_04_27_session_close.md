# ORG_DASHBOARD v55 — Session Close (2026-04-27 ~01:00 PT)

**Predecessors:** v54 (`ff946c1e64`) + v54-addendum (`192d6df580`)
**Window:** v54 → v55 ≈ 2 hours, post-restart cleanup wave

## What Changed Since v54

The post-v54 window resolved the largest remaining hygiene fronts: the **pheno workspace** received four origin-pushed cleanup commits (cache-adapter merge + 9 phantoms + casbin-wrapper materialize + 8 products-tier phantoms), bringing the long-running phantom-gitlink cleanup to a clean state. **Civis** PRs #253/#254 merged via squash-resolution; local now matches origin at `0137239`. **AgilePlus** PR #413 opened for the spec/013 cancelled marker. **KDesktopVirt** got a full org-pages scaffold (VitePress + workflow, commit `2426524`) and the org-pages enablement script (`353f2d777b`) is staged for four repos. **FocalPoint** scoped its templates-registry advisory to a 2-LINE axum migration fix (commit `38510bc657`) — application agent in flight, expected to clear 11 advisories. **W-93 cargo-deny re-verified at 27 (-46% from 50)**, confirmed final for the day. Pack corruption gc remains **blocked by Bash sandbox path-scoping** — steps 3-7 require user permission grant.

## Counters Table

| FocalPoint state | Xcode unblocked | templates-registry + reqwest 0.12 (`6a601b1`); 19 → **5 advisories** | RESOLVED (5 residual: paste/derivative/protobuf/fxhash/bincode — NOT reqwest) |

| Evalora | n/a | **DELETED from KooshaPari (confirmed)** | NEW BLOCKER — blocks pheno full audit + cache-adapter cargo metadata |

## Critical User-Action Queue

1. **CRITICAL — Grant Bash permission for pack-gc** in `/Users/kooshapari/CodeProjects/Phenotype/repos`. Steps 3-7 of corruption recovery refused by sandbox path-scoping. Required for `git fsck` clean.
2. **CRITICAL** — OpenAI API key rotation (carry-over from v53).
3. **CRITICAL** — AgentMCP README final approval.
4. **CRITICAL** — cliproxyapi 23 residual errors (user-blocked external API surface).
5. **CRITICAL** — Apple Dev prereqs for hwLedger WP21 codesign.
6. **HIGH (6)** + **MEDIUM (5)** — see `user-decisions runbook` (16 items total).

## Tomorrow Priorities

- **templates-registry 2-line fix application** — agent in flight; if not landed by session start, finalize the axum migration patch (clears 11 advisories → cargo-deny ~16).
- **GDK rebase decision** — long-divergent; choose rebase-onto-main vs. squash-merge.
- **helios-cli Strategy 1** — direct adoption of async_instrumented (per session_2026_04_25 notes).
- **argis-extensions Strategy C** — the deferred extraction path.
- **Pack-gc unblock** — run after user grants Bash sandbox permission.

## Takeaway

Day closed with **pheno + Civis fronts fully resolved**, cargo-deny final at **27**, and 53 repos pushed. Only blocker requiring human is **pack-gc sandbox permission**; everything else is queued and agent-actionable.

## Post-Write Update

Templates-registry 2-line axum migration **landed mid-write** as commit `5c4030c` — slightly outperformed the in-flight estimate.

- Cleared **13 advisories** (vs. estimated 11)
- FocalPoint dropped **19 → 6** advisories
- Org-wide cargo-deny projected: **27 → ~14** (-72% vs. W-92 baseline of 50)
- Final 6 FocalPoint advisories all flow through `reqwest 0.11`; **reqwest 0.12 follow-up** scoping in flight
- **W-94 snapshot agent in flight**; will confirm exact post-fix counts and replace the `~` placeholders in the counters table

The "templates-registry 2-line fix in flight" line in the v55 body and the Tomorrow Priorities item should be read as superseded by this addendum.

## Post-Final-Addendum Update

Late-late wave delivered confirmed numbers and a few surprises beyond the prior addendum's projections:

- **W-94 cargo-deny snapshot CONFIRMED at 13** (not the projected ~14). Org W-92 → W-94: **50 → 13 (-74%)**.
- **FocalPoint final: 19 → 5 advisories** (templates-registry refactor exceeded prediction). reqwest 0.11→0.12 applied (`6a601b1`), but agent caught a scoping error: **the 5 residual advisories are NOT reqwest-related** — they are paste/derivative/protobuf/fxhash/bincode.
- **pheno SBOM bootstrap: 11/21** SBOMs landed; **org total now 132 SBOMs across 7 workspaces** (was 121).
- **/tmp creep round-2 prune: 11 GB → 3.8 GB** (-7.2 GB reclaimed). Disk free now **39 GiB** (was 32 GiB at v55-write).
- **Pack corruption re-classified**: the reported 217-object regression was an **fsck line-count artifact**; real growth is **+5 unique objects**. New memory `feedback_fsck_line_count_artifact` in flight to lock in the diagnostic pattern.
- **Evalora investigation: DELETED from KooshaPari (confirmed)**. New blocker: blocks pheno full audit + cache-adapter cargo metadata resolution. Added to counters table.
