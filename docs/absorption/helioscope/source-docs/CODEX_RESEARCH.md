### 2.2 Key Differentiators

**Codex CLI Strengths:**

- Open source (Apache 2.0) - can be self-hosted/extended
- Included with ChatGPT subscription
- Strong GitHub integration
- Cloud sandbox execution (safer)
- Generous session limits

**Codex CLI Weaknesses:**

- REPL non-standard behavior (uses React-based Ink, not readline)
- Shell command timeout issues (90% failure rate reported)
- Background process leak on interrupt
- 150s hard timeout on requests
- Poor frontend framework support (React issues)

---

## 3. User Friction Analysis

### 3.1 Top User Complaints (from GitHub Issues, HN, Reddit)

#### Critical Issues (Blocking)

1. **Shell Command Timeouts** (Issue #3765)

   - 90% of shell commands hang/timeout
   - No visibility into timeout reasons
   - User frustration: "90% failure rate"

2. **Background Process Leak** (Issue #7932)

   - Ctrl+C doesn't terminate spawned processes
   - Chrome instances spawn uncontrollably
   - No job control for long-running tasks

3. **Request Timeout at ~150s** (Issue #3478)

   - Hard timeout not configurable
   - Complex multi-file edits fail
   - VS Code extension handles better (unclear why)

4. **Usage Limit Hit** (widespread)
   - "You've hit your usage limit" errors
   - Even with ChatGPT Plus
   - No clear way to check quota

#### UX Friction Issues

5. **Non-Standard REPL** (Discussion #520)

   - Ctrl+[Left/Right] instead of Option+[Left/Right]
   - Ctrl+E opens vi editor instead of end-of-line
   - Not using Node's built-in REPL/readline
   - Shift+Enter indicated but doesn't work

6. **Inconsistent Tool Execution**

   - Sometimes prompts user to run commands
   - Sometimes executes automatically
   - No clear logic for when each happens

7. **Organization Verification** (HN)
   - 90-day cooldown on org verification
   - Complicates professional/promotional use

## 4. Performance Optimization Opportunities

### 4.1 Timing Breakdown Analysis

Based on benchmark data from `llm_sla_benchmark.py`:

```
Component            │ Time    │ % of Total
────────────────────┼─────────┼────────────
TTFT                │ 6.76s  │ 67.1%
Network RTT          │ 0.05s  │  0.5%
Generation          │ 0.75s  │  7.5%
Overhead            │ 2.53s  │ 25.0%
────────────────────┼─────────┼────────────
TOTAL               │ 10.07s │ 100.0%
```

**Key Insight:** TTFT (Time to First Token) dominates at 67%. Reducing TTFT by 50% would improve overall latency by 33%.

### 4.2 Optimization Strategies

#### High Impact

1. **Streaming Optimization**

   - Current: Wait for full response before streaming
   - Opportunity: Stream tokens immediately on generation
   - Estimated improvement: 30-40% TTFT reduction

2. **Context Compression**

   - Current: Full file context sent to LLM
   - Opportunity: Summarize boilerplate, keep only relevant sections
   - Also reduces token costs

3. **Connection Pooling**
   - Current: New connection per request
   - Opportunity: Keepalive connections, HTTP/2 multiplexing
   - Estimated improvement: 20-30% latency reduction

#### Medium Impact

4. **Caching Strategy**

   - Cache prompt templates
   - Cache LLM responses for repeated queries
   - Local vector DB for codebase context

5. **Parallel Tool Execution**
   - Current: Sequential tool calls
   - Opportunity: Execute independent tools in parallel
   - Estimated improvement: 15-25% for multi-tool tasks
