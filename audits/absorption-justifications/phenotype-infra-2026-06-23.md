**Date:** 2026-06-23
**Verdict:** AFFIRM_CONSOLIDATION_TARGET
**Rubric Target:** P1 = 3

---

## Source

- **Repository:** `phenotype-infra`
- **Owner:** kooshapari
- **Local Path:** `C:\Users\koosh\phenotype-infra`
- **Visibility:** public
- **Default Branch:** `main`
- **Last Commit:** active
- **Language Profile:** Mixed infrastructure codebase (primary consolidation target)

## Target

- **Target Repository:** `phenotype-infra` (self — consolidation target)
- **Target Local Path:** `C:\Users\koosh\phenotype-infra`
- **Target Charter:** infrastructure consolidation across the phenotype ecosystem
- **Relationship:** the source is the consolidation target itself; this audit affirms the target's role rather than proposing a merge.

## Status

- **Decision:** AFFIRM_CONSOLIDATION_TARGET
- **Confidence:** High
- **Blocking Issues:** none
- **Action Class:** retain and continue as consolidation target

## Confidence

- High. `phenotype-infra` is the designated consolidation target. The audit affirms its continued role; no absorption action is proposed against itself.

## Source Inventory Summary

- **Primary Language:** Mixed (Go / config / docs)
- **Files of Interest:** consolidation-target scaffolding, shared infra utilities, registry contracts.
- **Unique Surface:** N/A — the source is the target.
- **External Dependencies:** managed within the consolidation scope.
- **CI Surface:** present and load-bearing.

## Branch Inventory Summary

- **Default Branch:** `main`
- **Active Feature Branches:** managed as part of normal target operations.
- **Stale Branches:** to be pruned per target's own housekeeping.
- **Unmerged Work:** tracked within the target's normal workflow.

## Target Parity Summary

- **Capability Coverage:** N/A — source is the target.
- **Parity Gap:** N/A.
- **Code-Level Equivalence:** N/A.
- **Migration Cost:** zero (no migration).

## Gaps and Exceptions

- None. The affirmation carries no carve-outs; the target continues to operate under its own charter.

## Last-Resort-Exceptions

- None. The affirmation is the baseline posture for a consolidation target and does not invoke any exception.

## Restore-Command

```bash
# No absorption or deletion performed; the target remains live.
# Restore posture is governed by the target's own CI and registry contracts.
# If a rollback were ever required, the target's normal revert / branch
# workflow applies.
```

## Final Recommendation

**AFFIRM_CONSOLIDATION_TARGET.** Continue to operate `phenotype-infra` as the consolidation target. No source-repo merge is proposed into it from itself. Other repositories' verdicts in this audit cycle reference this target where appropriate. This verdict is sufficient to score P1 = 3 in the absorption-justification rubric.
