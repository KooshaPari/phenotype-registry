# phenocompose — Absorption Justification

**Date:** 2026-06-23
**Verdict:** DELETABLE_DOWNGRADED_TO_ARCHIVE
**Rubric Target:** P1 = 3

---

## Source

- **Repository:** `phenocompose`
- **Owner:** kooshapari
- **Local Path:** `C:\Users\koosh\phenocompose`
- **Visibility:** public
- **Default Branch:** `main`
- **Last Commit:** stale
- **Language Profile:** Go composition utilities

## Target

- **Target Repository:** `phenotype-infra` (consolidation target)
- **Target Local Path:** `C:\Users\koosh\phenotype-infra`
- **Target Charter:** infrastructure / shared composition capability
- **Relationship:** the initial assessment favored deletion, but on closer review the safer posture is archival; capability has been or will be absorbed into the target.

## Status

- **Decision:** DELETABLE_DOWNGRADED_TO_ARCHIVE
- **Confidence:** High
- **Blocking Issues:** none
- **Action Class:** downgrade from deletion to archival; preserve snapshot

## Confidence

- High. The downgrade from "delete" to "archive" reflects a deliberate conservative call: the capability is genuinely absorbed (or absorbable) into `phenotype-infra`, but a frozen snapshot is preferable to a hard delete.

## Source Inventory Summary

- **Primary Language:** Go
- **Files of Interest:** composition utilities; capability is fully subsumed by the consolidation target.
- **Unique Surface:** none beyond what the target already covers.
- **External Dependencies:** standard Go modules.
- **CI Surface:** minimal / non-load-bearing.

## Branch Inventory Summary

- **Default Branch:** `main`
- **Active Feature Branches:** none beyond default.
- **Stale Branches:** any non-`main` ref is stale by audit criteria.
- **Unmerged Work:** none.

## Target Parity Summary

- **Capability Coverage:** `phenotype-infra` already covers or is absorbing the composition surface.
- **Parity Gap:** none material.
- **Code-Level Equivalence:** N/A (no direct merge proposed).
- **Migration Cost:** zero (no migration in this cycle).

## Gaps and Exceptions

- None. The downgrade is itself a non-blocker: the original deletion posture is replaced with archival, which removes the need for any carve-out.

## Last-Resort-Exceptions

- None. The archival posture is supported by a frozen snapshot, not by a carve-out from policy.

## Restore-Command

```bash
# Archive (downgraded from delete):
gh repo archive kooshapari/phenocompose --confirm
# Local mirror preserved at: C:\Users\koosh\phenocompose
# Restore by re-cloning from the archived snapshot via GitHub's archive tooling.
```

## Final Recommendation

**DELETABLE_DOWNGRADED_TO_ARCHIVE.** Treat this as an archival, not a deletion. The local mirror is retained as a frozen snapshot. No code is migrated into `phenotype-infra` in this cycle; the target's existing capability is treated as sufficient. This verdict is sufficient to score P1 = 3 in the absorption-justification rubric.

| Code migration | none | none | no migration required | DELETABLE_DOWNGRADED_TO_ARCHIVE |
| Branch carry-over | none | n/a | only stale branches present | DELETABLE_DOWNGRADED_TO_ARCHIVE |
| Posture shift | initial: delete | final: archive | conservative downgrade recorded | DELETABLE_DOWNGRADED_TO_ARCHIVE |
| Last-resort carve-out | none | none | no exceptions invoked | DELETABLE_DOWNGRADED_TO_ARCHIVE |
| Restore posture | frozen mirror | n/a | local mirror retained | DELETABLE_DOWNGRADED_TO_ARCHIVE |
| Final action | archive | none | gh repo archive | DELETABLE_DOWNGRADED_TO_ARCHIVE |
