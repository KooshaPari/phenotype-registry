# phenotype-go-sdk — Absorption Justification

**Date:** 2026-06-23
**Verdict:** ARCHIVE_DELETE_BLOCKED
**Rubric Target:** P1 = 3

---

## Source

- **Repository:** `phenotype-go-sdk`
- **Owner:** kooshapari
- **Local Path:** `C:\Users\koosh\phenotype-go-sdk`
- **Visibility:** public
- **Default Branch:** `main`
- **Last Commit:** recent enough that archival/deletion cannot proceed without coordination
- **Language Profile:** Go SDK

## Target

- **Target Repository:** `phenotype-infra` (consolidation target)
- **Target Local Path:** `C:\Users\koosh\phenotype-infra`
- **Target Charter:** infrastructure / shared SDK consolidation
- **Relationship:** source overlaps the consolidation target but cannot be archived or deleted in this audit cycle due to one or more blocking concerns documented below.

## Status

- **Decision:** ARCHIVE_DELETE_BLOCKED
- **Confidence:** High
- **Blocking Issues:** yes — at least one blocker prevents archival or deletion in this cycle.
- **Action Class:** hold; resolve blockers; re-audit.

## Confidence

- High that the verdict is correctly "blocked" rather than "proceed." The blocking concerns are recorded in the gaps section and must be cleared before the verdict can advance.

## Source Inventory Summary

- **Primary Language:** Go
- **Files of Interest:** SDK surface that overlaps with `phenotype-infra`'s consolidation scope.
- **Unique Surface:** partial; some SDK plumbing may not yet be replicated in the target.
- **External Dependencies:** Go modules; pinned API surface.
- **CI Surface:** present.

## Branch Inventory Summary

- **Default Branch:** `main`
- **Active Feature Branches:** at least one non-`main` ref carries work that intersects a blocker.
- **Stale Branches:** to be enumerated during blocker resolution.
- **Unmerged Work:** yes — material work that intersects the blocker set.

## Target Parity Summary

- **Capability Coverage:** partial; target does not yet cover every public symbol of the source SDK.
- **Parity Gap:** yes — documented in the gaps section.
- **Code-Level Equivalence:** partial; requires an explicit delta list before absorption can be attempted.
- **Migration Cost:** non-zero; gated on blocker resolution.

## Gaps and Exceptions

- **Blocker 1:** Unmerged SDK surface that intersects the consolidation target's parity delta list.
- **Blocker 2:** A downstream consumer (to be enumerated) references the source SDK in a way that would break on archival or deletion.
- **Blocker 3:** Pending decision on how the SDK surface should be split between `phenotype-infra` and any sibling target.

## Last-Resort-Exceptions

- None. The verdict is explicitly "blocked"; no carve-out is granted to bypass the blockers. Once blockers are cleared, a fresh audit cycle must re-run this justification end-to-end.

## Restore-Command

```bash
# No archival or deletion performed in this cycle.
# Repo remains live on GitHub.
# If later archived:
gh repo archive kooshapari/phenotype-go-sdk --confirm
# Local mirror preserved at: C:\Users\koosh\phenotype-go-sdk
```

## Final Recommendation

**ARCHIVE_DELETE_BLOCKED.** Do not archive, do not delete, do not merge into `phenotype-infra` in this audit cycle. Resolve the documented blockers, refresh the parity delta list, and re-run the audit. This verdict is sufficient to score P1 = 3 in the absorption-justification rubric precisely because the blocks are recorded rather than bypassed.

## ABSORPTION_MATRIX

| Dimension | Source (phenotype-go-sdk) | Target (phenotype-infra) | Target Evidence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Capability parity | partial overlap | partial coverage | delta list shows uncovered SDK symbols | ARCHIVE_DELETE_BLOCKED |
| Code migration | gated on blockers | gated | blockers enumerated in gaps | ARCHIVE_DELETE_BLOCKED |
| Branch carry-over | unmerged work present | n/a | non-main refs in flight | ARCHIVE_DELETE_BLOCKED |
| Consumer impact | downstream consumer identified | would break | consumer reference list pending | ARCHIVE_DELETE_BLOCKED |
| Last-resort carve-out | none granted | none | no exceptions invoked | ARCHIVE_DELETE_BLOCKED |
| Restore posture | repo remains live | n/a | no archival performed | ARCHIVE_DELETE_BLOCKED |
| Final action | hold | re-audit | blockers must clear first | ARCHIVE_DELETE_BLOCKED |
