## Target

- **Receiving repo:** `KooshaPari/phenotype-infra` (https://github.com/KooshaPari/phenotype-infra)
- **Receiving path:** `docs/absorbed-from-eyetracker/`
- **Local mirror path:** `C:\Users\koosh\eyetracker` (full clone)
- **Bundle file:** none (live repo; no bundle needed)

### Absorption-target canonical files

| Canonical role | Path |
|---|---|
| Manifest template | `bin/ABSORPTION_TEMPLATE.md` |
| Audit rubric | `registry/audit-absorption-justification/schema.json` |
| Audit grader | `registry/audit-absorption-justification/grade.sh` |
| Cluster spine doc | `docs/compute-infra-subtree.md` |
| Project-card root | `registry/projects/` |

## Status

- [x] **AFFIRM** — repo remains active; absorption is partial / progressive.

**Confidence:** HIGH

**Gate Tooling Reference:** `bin/repo-delete-gate.sh` (and `repo-delete-gate.ps1` for Windows runners) at `phenotype-tooling/bin/`. The gate enforces a manifest-presence check before any `gh repo delete` invocation.

**Authoritative Org ADRs (Upstream Cross-Reference):**
- ADR-008 — consolidation over proliferation.
- ADR-039 — monorepo preference for SDK-layer code.
- ECO-022 — compute/infra subtree registry correction.

## Target Parity Summary

| Parity concept | Source | Target Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Absorption template | (this audit's structure) | `bin/ABSORPTION_TEMPLATE.md` |
| 7-pillar rubric | (scored by grader) | `registry/audit-absorption-justification/schema.json` |
| Grader script | (scored by grader) | `registry/audit-absorption-justification/grade.sh` |
| Delete-gate tooling | (cited in P7) | `bin/repo-delete-gate.sh` |
| Cluster spine doc | (referenced in upstream cross-ref) | `docs/compute-infra-subtree.md` |

Parity: PARTIAL for the code surface — eyetracker is a standalone Rust workspace with no migration in progress; 7 crates are self-contained.

## ABSORPTION_MATRIX

| Source Item | Source Evidence | Category | Source State | Target Repo | Target Evidence | Status | Deletion Justification | Risk if Deleted | Required Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `eyetracker/Rust workspace` | `gh api repos/KooshaPari/eyetracker/languages` | sdk-code | active | `KooshaPari/phenotype-infra` | `docs/absorbed-from-eyetracker/` | AFFIRM | Not yet absorbed; cluster-discovery audit | Medium; unique hardware bindings | cluster-discovery baseline |
| `eyetracker/7 crates` | `dir crates/` | branch-coverage | active | `KooshaPari/phenotype-infra` | `docs/absorbed-from-eyetracker/` | AFFIRM | Not yet absorbed | Low-medium | see WORKSPACE_INVENTORY |
| `eyetracker/.github/workflows/` (9+) | `gh api` API listing | ci-workflow | active | `KooshaPari/phenotype-infra` | `docs/absorbed-from-eyetracker/` | AFFIRM | Not yet absorbed | Low | scanned, not migrated |
| `eyetracker/docs/` + `README.md` | `gh api` API listing | documentation | active | `KooshaPari/phenotype-infra` | `docs/absorbed-from-eyetracker/` | AFFIRM | Not yet absorbed | Low | enumerated, not migrated |

## Last-Resort-Exceptions

- **Rebuttal #1 (Q1): "Delete eyetracker now."** Rebutted: eyetracker is a live Rust workspace providing hardware-agnostic eye-tracking (Tobii + V4L2) used by UX research instrumentation. **However**, no code has been migrated yet.

- **Rebuttal #2: (Q2) "eyetracker is unmaintained."** Rebutted: 9+ CI workflows and a 0.1.0-alpha tag plus recent commits to `main` indicate active maintenance.

- **Rebuttal #3: (Q3) "Merge into phenotype-infra."** Rebutted: partial absorption into `phenotype-infra` is the long-term goal, but eyetracker's 7-crate Cargo workspace is tightly coupled to its standalone deployment model and requires dedicated test fixtures (`eyetracker-test-infra`).

This item cannot absorb into `phenotype-infra` without a dedicated eye-tracking hardware adapter; it must remain as a standalone repo until phenotype-infra adopts runtime support for embedded Linux hardware bindings. The **residual gap** is that the Tobii SDK dependency requires proprietary headers not in the public registry.

No exceptions to the AFFIRM verdict are granted.

## Restore-Command

```bash
# Live repo (active source): restore by re-adding remote + fetch.
cd C:\Users\koosh\eyetracker
git remote add origin https://github.com/KooshaPari/eyetracker.git
git fetch --all --prune

# Disaster-recovery posture:
gh api repos/KooshaPari/eyetracker           # confirm repo still exists (200 OK)
gh repo clone KooshaPari/eyetracker /tmp/eyetracker-migration
```

**Restore prerequisites:** GitHub org read access for `KooshaPari/eyetracker`.
**Documented restore path:** `git remote add origin https://github.com/KooshaPari/eyetracker.git && git fetch --all`.
