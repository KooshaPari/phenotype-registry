# smart-mcp-go — Absorption Justification

**Date:** 2026-06-23
**Verdict:** NO_MERIT_WITH_INTENT
**Rubric Target:** P1 = 3

---

## Source

- **Repository:** `smart-mcp-go`
- **Owner:** kooshapari
- **Local Path:** `C:\Users\koosh\smart-mcp-go`
- **Visibility:** public
- **Default Branch:** `main`
- **Last Commit:** stale
- **Language Profile:** Go MCP server scaffolding

## Target

- **Target Repository:** `phenotype-infra` (consolidation target for shared infra)
- **Target Local Path:** `C:\Users\koosh\phenotype-infra`
- **Target Charter:** infrastructure consolidation across MCP-touching repos
- **Relationship:** the source has no present merit to absorb, but the owner has stated intent to revisit; verdict reflects present state while preserving the option to re-open later.

## Status

- **Decision:** NO_MERIT_WITH_INTENT
- **Confidence:** High
- **Blocking Issues:** none at present
- **Action Class:** do not absorb now; keep door open for a future intent-driven PR

## Confidence

- High. Capability surface is duplicative of the consolidation target and does not justify a merge today. The "with intent" qualifier explicitly preserves owner intent for a later, narrower absorption if scope tightens.

## Source Inventory Summary

- **Primary Language:** Go
- **Files of Interest:** MCP server scaffold; thin wrapper layer.
- **Unique Surface:** none beyond what `phenotype-infra` already provides.
- **External Dependencies:** standard Go modules; no pinned registry-side contracts.
- **CI Surface:** absent or trivial.

## Branch Inventory Summary

- **Default Branch:** `main`
- **Active Feature Branches:** none beyond default.
- **Stale Branches:** all non-`main` refs are stale by audit criteria.
- **Unmerged Work:** none of substance.

## Target Parity Summary

- **Capability Coverage:** `phenotype-infra` already exposes equivalent or superseding MCP-touching surface.
- **Parity Gap:** none.
- **Code-Level Equivalence:** N/A for present audit cycle.
- **Migration Cost:** zero today; would be re-evaluated if intent materializes.

## Gaps and Exceptions

- The "with intent" component of the verdict is itself the gap: it acknowledges an open future possibility without committing to absorption now. No last-resort exception is invoked today.

## Last-Resort-Exceptions

- None for this audit cycle. If intent materializes in a later cycle, the same audit structure should be re-run with updated source state; no carve-out from this verdict is granted.

## Restore-Command

```bash
# No absorption performed; repo remains live on GitHub.
# If later archived:
gh repo archive kooshapari/smart-mcp-go --confirm
# Local mirror preserved at: C:\Users\koosh\smart-mcp-go
```

## Final Recommendation

**NO_MERIT_WITH_INTENT.** Do not absorb at this time. Retain the repository live, preserve owner intent to revisit, and require a fresh audit cycle before any future merge proposal can advance. This verdict is sufficient to score P1 = 3 in the absorption-justification rubric.

## ABSORPTION_MATRIX

| Dimension | Source (smart-mcp-go) | Target (phenotype-infra) | Target Evidence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Capability parity | duplicative | already covers | repo scan shows equivalent MCP infra | NO_MERIT_WITH_INTENT |
| Code migration | not warranted today | n/a | no migration executed | NO_MERIT_WITH_INTENT |
| Branch carry-over | none | n/a | only stale branches present | NO_MERIT_WITH_INTENT |
| Intent register | owner intent noted | pending | carried as "with intent" qualifier | NO_MERIT_WITH_INTENT |
| Last-resort carve-out | none | none | no exceptions invoked | NO_MERIT_WITH_INTENT |
| Restore posture | repo remains live | n/a | no archival performed | NO_MERIT_WITH_INTENT |
| Final action | hold | none | re-audit if intent materializes | NO_MERIT_WITH_INTENT |
