## 2026-04-30 — Journey traceability adoption

Category: GOVERNANCE

### Context

Cross-repo docs audit showed that journey keyframes and recordings were missing
from many docs surfaces. The shared standard was added in `phenotype-infra`
first, then propagated to the docs hub, then to the handbook.

### Finding / Decision

PhenoHandbook should carry a governance page for journey traceability so the
pattern registry itself models the evidence contract it asks other repos to
follow. The page points at the shared standard and names hwLedger as the
reference implementation for `ShotGallery` and `RecordingEmbed`.

### Impact

Creates a reusable docs contract for future patterns and repo docs. The
handbook can now point contributors at a concrete journey-evidence standard
instead of only prose guidelines.
