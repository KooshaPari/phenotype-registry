# AGENTS.md — PhenoHandbook

**Date:** 2026-06-19
**Status:** ACTIVE (lightly used spine; read-only reference per fleet `AGENTS.md` Decision D)
**Bucket:** spine (not a pheno-*-lib / phenotype-*-sdk / federated service per ADR-023)

## What

Living documentation for design patterns, anti-patterns, guidelines, methodologies, and
checklists across the Phenotype ecosystem. Doc-only MkDocs/VitePress site; no runtime
code. Patterns link to specs in `PhenoSpecs` and inform template generation in `HexaKit`.
Referenced from ~80% of fleet ADRs (per `CHARTER.md` success criteria).

## When to use

- **Looking for an established pattern** before writing new code (auth, caching, async,
  CI, observability, etc.) → `ls patterns/<domain>/`.
- **Checking what NOT to do** → `ls anti-patterns/`.
- **Onboarding a new contributor** to the "Phenotype way" → start with `README.md` then
  `CHARTER.md`.
- **Drafting a new ADR** → copy the template from `adrs/00-template.md` (MADR format).
- **Reviewing whether a pattern is still valid** → read the rationale + trade-off
  section; patterns include "when to break the rule" notes.

## When NOT to use

- **Don't open PRs against `PhenoHandbook` for app-level work.** App-level repos (PAUSED
  per ADR-023) do not write here. Substrate (pheno-*-lib / phenotype-*-sdk) writes here
  only when canonicalizing a new pattern, never as scratch space.
- **Don't duplicate content already in `PhenoSpecs` or `phenotype-registry`.** PhenoSpecs
  = canonical specs; `phenotype-registry` = boundary index. PhenoHandbook is patterns +
  anti-patterns, not specs.
- **Don't treat a pattern as dogma.** Per `CHARTER.md` Tenet 2: context matters. Patterns
  include rationale + trade-offs + "when to break the rule". Re-litigate in an ADR if
  the context has shifted.
- **Don't add ad-hoc tooling instructions** (`how to run X`, `setup Y`). Those belong in
  the consuming repo's `CLAUDE.md` or `Taskfile.yml`.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `patterns/<domain>/*.md` | Design patterns by domain (auth, caching, async, observability, …) |
| `anti-patterns/*.md` | What NOT to do; retired patterns with rationale |
| `adrs/*.md` | Architecture Decision Records (MADR format) |
| `docs/` | Long-form docs, intent pages, journey-evidence contracts |
| `governance/` | Happy-path checklist, pre-commit guards |
| `mkdocs.yml` + `package.json` | MkDocs / VitePress site build |

## Conventions

- **Commits:** Conventional Commits (`docs:` is the dominant type for pattern edits).
- **Branches:** `docs/<pattern-slug>` for new patterns; `chore/<req-id>-<slug>-<date>` for
  governance / meta-bundle work (this branch is `chore/handbook-meta-2026-06-19`).
- **PRs:** Open against `KooshaPari/PhenoHandbook:main`. No self-merge on substantive
  content; meta-bundle chores may self-merge per fleet norm.
- **License:** Triple-licensed MIT / Apache-2.0 (see `LICENSE-MIT`, `LICENSE-APACHE`).
- **Substrate placement:** `spine` (not a buildable artifact). No `[workspace]` member,
  no `Cargo.toml` / `pyproject.toml` / `go.mod` of its own.

## Authority

- Fleet spine governance: `/repos/AGENTS.md` (parent) + `findings/` + `docs/adr/`.
- Sibling spines: `phenodocs` (org docs hub), `PhenoSpecs` (canonical specs),
  `phenotype-registry` (boundary index), `phenotype-infra` (infra-as-code).
- Source of truth for new patterns: an ADR in `adrs/` first, then the pattern file.
